## Technologies Used

LLM: Google Gemini LLM
Vector Store: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
Embeddings: SentenceTransformers
Conversational AI Framework: LangChain
Database: MySQL, Graph Database
Data Visualization: Integrated data visualization features using appropriate libraries and tools

## Architecture

The architecture of the chatbot is designed to convert natural language queries into SQL, execute them against the MySQL database, and return results in a user-friendly format. Here's a high-level overview:

### Query Parsing: The chatbot uses LangChain to parse the user's natural language input.

### Embedding Generation: SentenceTransformers generate embeddings of both the input query and database schema.

### Schema Matching: FAISS is utilized to match the query against the database schema and generate the most relevant SQL.

### SQL Execution: The chatbot executes the generated SQL on the MySQL database.

### Results Presentation: Results are presented to the user in a human-friendly format, with options for data visualization.

Installation
To set up this project locally:

Configure your API keys and database credentials in the config.py file.
Configure the SQL Databases accordingly.
Usage
Run the chatbot:open in terminal and run the code
streamlit run sql-chatbot.py

Input natural language queries and receive SQL-generated results, along with visualizations if needed.
